Approach to solving algorithms 

## Description

This is a personal study guide for algorithms that I have worked through at leetcode.com
After a description of the problem, I provide what my intuition is to approach how to solve the problem. Then I added comments within the algorithm to explain each step.
This is designed to help me prepare for technical interviews.
